Average global tempuratures have risen more than 1 degree Celcius relative to the late 19th century average
  Rate of tempurature increase at any time is 10 times faster than at any time in Earths past 800,000 years

Thermohaline circulation: Ocean currents of shallow, warm, salty water and deep, cold, less salty water

The tempurature of our atmosphere results from four key sources:
  -Solar energy: how much light we are getting from the sun
  -Greenhouse gasses: how much heat is being trapped by our atmosphere
  -Aerosols: particles in the atmosphere that block light and thus cause cooling 
  -Albedo: how much light is being reflected or absorbed by a surface 

While tempurature over the last 20 years have increased, the amount of energy the Earth has recieved from the Sun has decreased

Our eyes can only see a very narrow range of the full light spectrum

The surface of the Earth converts visible light from the sun into infrared light (heat)

The greenhouse effect works by converting visible light to heat (longwave radiation)

In our atmosphere, greenhouse gases allow visible light to pass, but trap some of the re-admitted radiation in the atmophere

Greenhouse gasses are required for the warm tempurate climate that has allowed life to florish on Earth

Humans have added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere causing more heat to be trapped and tempuratues to rise.

Humans can have a significant influence on greenhouse gases (like CO2) because they account for only a tiny fraction of our atmosphere

Over the past 100 years, the average annual emissions of CO2 from humans is 150x more than the CO2 emissions from volcanoes

Coal-fired power plants are the largest contributors of CO2. A single coal-fired power plant can use 10,000 tons of coal per day
  -the amount carried by a 100 car train

Aerosols are any small particles suspended in the atmosphere that block sunlight - thus causing cooling

Aerosols are both produced by humans and volcanoes

Human sources of aerosols can result from burning fossil fuels

In theory, cleaning up vehicle ehaust can increase global tempuratures
  BUT the greenhouse gases cased y these cars outweigh the aerosols

Albedo is the capacity of a surface to reflect light
 Low albedo: ocean water reflects 10% of sunlight and converts 90% to heat
 High albedo: ice relects 90% of sunlight and converts only 10% to heat

Melting of ice leads to more surface water, lowering global albedo

There have been large changes in tempurature that have occured throughout Earth's history due to changes in Earth orbital parameters

These long-term changes are due to Milankovic Cycles
  Earths tilt and eccentricity, and wobble/precession
