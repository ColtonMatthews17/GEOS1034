Swordfishing was originally done by harpooning
Longline fishing has replaced harpooning

Longline fishing is a controversial means of commercial fishing where boats drag up to 
  40miles of line with over 1000 hooks
    -Leads to overfighing of swordfish (including juveniles) and the killing of seabirds, sea turtles,
      sharks, and anything else unlucky enough to get caught
    -Since the advent of longline fishing, stocks of swordfish have dropped by more the 90%

The best fishing grounds for swordfish off the northeast coast are now te shallows of the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap 
  (The rest of the shelf has been fished out)

10,000 fisherman have died

A hurricane is a tropical cyclone, an organization of numerous thunderstorms into a massive, single, rotating storm system.

Tropical cyclones simply go by different names depending on where they occur
  -Hurricanes are the same as typhoons and cyclones

Tropical cyclones get their energy from warm tropical waters

When hurricanes ventrue over land they lose their enrgy source,
  causing their winds to diminish rapidly

Hurricanes cannot form over land

When hurricanes venture north away from warm southern waters they aso lost their source of energy and diminish

Hurricane season is August through october, when tropical waters are the warmest

Cyclones rotate in opposite directions inthe northern and southern hemispheres
  Southern hemisphere, clockwise
  Northern hemisphere, counter-clockwise

Cyclones rotate because the Earth is rotating (the Coriolis effect)

Without rotation induced by the Coriolis effect, groups of thunderstorms cannot organize themselves
  into a cyclone

One of the most distinct characteristics of a cyclone is its calm eye

The eye has the lowest pressures and lowest winds, while eyewall has the highest winds

Descending air will always warm due to increasing pressure

Strong cyclone winds blow alot of debris around, including cars

The Saffir-Simpson Intensity Scale classifies hurricanes based on wind speed

Cyclones work their way up and down the Saffir-Simpson Intensity Scale

Direct measurements using dropsondes are the most accurate means to understand the properties of a hurricane
  -Combined with numerical models, this data can help us estimate how powerful a hurricane may get and where it might be heading
  -Dropsonde: An instrument dropped from an aircraft into a hurricane to measure wind speed and direction, humidity,
                temperature, and atmospheric pressure

Storm Surges: cyclone winds push water onshore, causing severe coastal floosing

Surges are greatest on the side of the cyclone where the winds are blowing on shore

Extratropical cyclones, lik nor'easters, form far from the tropics (which is why they are "extratropical")
  -Nor'easters get their name from the direction from which the wind comes on shore along the US coast

Nor'easters from when cold artic air collides with warm, moist air above the Gulf Stream
  -They are referred to as cold core storms since cold air underlies them, as opposed to hurricanes which
    are warm core storms since they are underline by the warm air of the tropics

Nor'easters can be just as destructive as hurricanes, plus they can bing heavy snow

Nor-easters differ from hurricanes in several ways
  -Source of energy
    -Nor easters require a cold front (cold core) that lifts the warm moist air
  -Locations
    -Nor'easters from in the north atlantic; hurricanes form in the tropics
  -Snow
    -Only Nor'easters can bring snow
  -Season
    Nor'easters are most common in the winder, hurricanes occur in the late summer (Aug-Oct)
  -A distinct eye
    -Nor'easters rarely form a distict eye

The Perfect Storm
  -Large thunderstor system (low pressure) from the Gulf Stream
  -Cold front from northwest
  -Hurricane Grace

Rogue waves are ocean waves whose height is more than twice the hight of other waves in the area

The draupner wave, a single giant wave measured at an oil platform in the north sea in 1995,
  confirmed the existence of rogue waves, which ahd previosly been considered near-mythical

It is now believed that at any given moment 10 giant rogue waves are churning through the world's oceans

In the past two decades; rogue waves are suspected of sinking dozens of bg ships and taking hundreds of lives

Rogue waves are thugh to be caused by one of two phenomena
  -Merging waves: waves traveling same direction different speeds combine
  -Ocean currents: waves and winds heading into powerful ocean currents may cause a surge of water to rise


Coast Guard Aviation Survival Technician/Recue Swimmer school(A-School)
  -Prospective rescue swimmers take a 6-moth build-up training course for physical conditioning
  -The toughest part of A-school is the "non-compliant survivor" test

Hurricane safety:
  -Hurricanes are slow movers. Once you hear about it, chances are you have several days to finalize your plans
  -Prepare
    -Bring in all outside furniture
    -Consider taping up your windows
    -Be sure you are well supplied with and prescription drugs
    -Put all of your valuables into clear-plastic bags
  -To evacuate or not?
    -Mobile home / high rise / area prone to storm surge EVACUATE
    -If you are going to evacuate, go early, find housing, have time to change plans
  -If staying
    -Gather enough food and water to survive up to a week or more
    -Be ready to shelter in place as with a tornado
    -Emergency supplies on hand

Dealiest cyclone all time: Bhola Cyclone, Bangladesh 1970
  Killed up to 550,000 people


Hurricane Patricia 2015 had the strongest sustained winds ever recorded

Strongest cyclone to ever make landfall: Typhoon Haiyan (2013)
  Hit phillipines at full strength

Largest: Hurricane Sandy, (2012)

Costliest: Hurricane Katrina (2005) cost 108 Billion dollars

Katrina caused over 50 levees (floodwalls) to fail, leaving new orleans more than 10 fet under water

New orleans is under sea level

Longest sustained cat 5 winds: Typhoon Nancy (1961)
  155mph winds lasted 5.5 days

Longest lasting and farthest traveling: Hurricane/Typhoon John (1994)
  Lasted 31 days and covered 8,000 miles

Biggest recorded wave: The perfect storm (1991)
  Wave of 100 feet, 31m

Hurricane Dorian, Cat 5, decimated the bahamas this year
