Exam4 / Final Review

Q&A Video

What type of building provides the most protection from a tornado?
  -Concrete Structure
-----------------------------------

Weather fronts mark the boundary of air masses that hvae different temperatures
  -Cold fronts give rise to strong thunderstorms because they rapidly push warm moist air high into the atmosphere
  -The warm air mass is quickly driven upwards causing strong thnderstorms

What happens when air rises? It expands and cools

__ air is heavier than moist air at the same tempurature. Dry

__ is caused by a strong seperation of electric charge that builds up between clouds and the ground. Lightning

Hail forms when thunderstorm updrafts are strong enough to repeatedly circulate ice particles above and below the __ level. Freezing

Thunder is caused by the rapid expansion of __ __ air. Super heated

A horizontal vortex from strong wind shear rotates into a veritcal orientation causing the supercell

Supercells are different from large storms because they have large scale __. Rotation

Cold downdrafts carrying hail often lead tornadoes

Do tornado winds blow towards or away from tornadoes? Tornado

Most US tornadoes occur in te midwest and the south, which experience about how many per year? One thousand

The midwest has the right ingredients for tornado formation

Peak tornado season in the U.S. occurs in the __, when waters from the Gulf of Mexico begin to warm,
  while cold air masses still descend from the north. Spring

Enhanced Fugita scale rates tornado strength based on the __, which is used to estimate wind speed. Damage

Clouds are classified based on their __. Height
  Higher clouds carry stronger winds and more rain -> thunderstorms

Tornado Safety
  If indoors: Go to the basement
  If no basement: Get away from windows, stay on the ground floor, preferably small

Which type of building provides with the most protection from a tornado? Concrete

"Hiding" under an overpass? Bad ideo

Whats the biggest danger from being too close to a tornado? Debris

Can a tornado pick up a toss a car around? Yes
Can wildfires cause tornadoes? Yes

Longline fishing is a controversial means of commercial fishing where boats drag up to XX miles of line with over 1,000 hooks.
  -XX = 40 miles 

What is the difference between a hurricane, cyclone, and a typhoon? Location
  Therefore, is a hurricane a cyclone? Yes

Tropical cyclones get their energy from __ __? Warm Water

Peak North American hurricane season is __ through __, when tropical waters are the warmest. August, October

What happens when hurricanes travel over land? They lose their energy source and rapidly weaken

Why cant cyclones form at the equator? There is no Corolis Effect

What can we infer about the hurricane eye? low pressure, low wind speeds
What can we infer about the eye wall? low pressure, high wind speeds

The Saffir-Simpson Intensity Scale classifies hurricanes based on __ __? wind speeds

__ __: cyclone winds push water onshore, causing severe coastal flooding. Storm Surge

Direct measurements using __ that are dropped from planes into a cyclone ar ethe most accurate means to understand the properties.
  Dropsonds

Nor'easters form when __ collides with __. Cold arctic air collides with the gulf stream

Nor'easters vs hurricanes:
  -Source of energy: Nor'easters require a cold front that lifts the warm moist air
  -Locations: north atlantic vs tropics
  -Snow: only nor'easters bring snow
  -Season: nor'easters are most common in winter, vs late summer
  -A distinct eye: nor'easters rarely forma  distinct eye

But they do not differ in the __. Damage

The perfect storm: What were the 3 factors?
  -Cold fron from arctic
  -Warm moist air mass from the north atlantic
  -Hurricane grace

Rogue waves are thought to be caused by one of two phenomena
  -Merging waves, waves traveling same direction different speeds combine
  -Occean current: waves and winds heading into a powerful ocean current may cause a surge of water to rise

How high are these waves? Very
Can they sink large ships? Yes

With over 500,000 deaths, Bhola Cyclone in Bangladesh was the deadliest all time
Typhoon Haiyan was the strongest cyclone ever to make landfall

What can you infer from this image? Hurricanes can turn into typhoons

Global warming refers to the ongoing rise in global average temperatures
Climate change referse to changes in climate: hot/cold, wet/dry, frequency and severity of storms brought by global warming

We have been warmer in the past

__ are any small particles suspended in the atmosphere that block sunlight - thus causing cooling. Aerosols

Is every place on the earth getting warmer? No

Weather: The condition in the atmosohere at a particular place and time
Climate: the average weather over a long broad area over a long time period
