Volcanic Catastrophes

Oct9---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Movie: Supervolcano(2005)

The worlds biggest and most deady volcanic eruptions
  -Mostly on the pacific Ring of Fire

Volcano Explosivity Index(VEI): A scale that is determined by the volume of ash and other rock
  -Mt. St. Helens is a VEI 5

In 79 AD an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum

Here's why we stuy it:
  -2,000 people were killed
  -A description of the eruption was written down by Pliny the Younger
  -Pompeii was buried under ~20 feet of ash and lost from history for 1500 years, but was preserved by the ash and dug out
  -The ash preserved the forms of the dead

Mount Vesuvius is a stratovolcano formed by a subduction zone along the northeast coast of Italy

Mount Vesuvius is one of the most active volcanoes in the world.
  -People ran from an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 3580 B.C, leaving these footprints in fossilized ash.
  -It has erupted more than 50 times in the last 25,000 years
  -US B-25 Vomvers passed close to Mt. Vesuvius during its latest eruption
  -Erupted 79AD ******************************* REMEMBER THIS

Pompeii was rediscovered in 1599, and voer the past 250 years the ash been removed to reveal an ancient society

On the second da of the eruption, super hot toxic clouds of gas and debris blasted down the slopes of
  Vesuvius an overwhelmed Pompeii, killing everyone who had not left yet

Preserved for All Time
  -The gas clouds were hot enough to kill -but not burn- the bodies
  -The bodies burned in time-hardened ash eventually decayed, leaving hollow spaces
  -When found, these spaces were filed with plaster to form casts of the victims at the moment of their deaths

Plinian eruptions are named after Pliny the Younger, who wrote down an incredible account
  of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii

The destruction of Pompeii inspired many artists and writers

Bulwer-Lytton's novel inspired an Italian silent movie, considered to be the first important historical epic fimed on a grand scale
50 years later a depiction of Pompeii's destruction is more elaborate, but still a bit understated

In-Class Question

How do we measure how big an explosive eruption is relative to others?
  A By the volume of lava
  B By the volume of ash and other rock
  C By the size of the explosive crater
  D By the number of fatalities

Answer: B

Naples today sits at the foot of a sleeping giant

Yellowstone: A hidden supervolcano
  -Yellowstone has had three extremely large eruptions in the past 2.1 million years,
     ranging from 280 to 2500 times bigger than the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption

Hot-Spot volcanism
  -Hot buoyant mantle plumes rise from the core/mantle boundary
  -Plumes melt when they get near the surface(depressurized melting)
  -The motion of the plates over stationary hotspots leads to a chain of volcanoes

The hawaiian islands are at the end of a long chain of hotspot volcanoes
The hawaiian islands are an age-prograssive hot spot track

One explanation is called the Mantle Plume Model
Most hotspot tracks are in the oceans

Yellowstone & Snake-River Plain Volcanism is a age-prograssive track of volcanism
  -The mantle plume model only works if the North America plate has been moving southwestward over a mantle

In-Class Question

How do we know Hawaiian volcanoes are from hotspot volcanism?
  A From the size of its past eruptions
  B Because they are located above an ancient subducted slab and not a hot spot
  C Because they consist of a chain of age progressive volcanoes
  D All of the above

Answer: C
