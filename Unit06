Volcanic Catastrophes

Oct9---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Movie: Supervolcano(2005)

The worlds biggest and most deady volcanic eruptions
  -Mostly on the pacific Ring of Fire

Volcano Explosivity Index(VEI): A scale that is determined by the volume of ash and other rock
  -Mt. St. Helens is a VEI 5

In 79 AD an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum

Here's why we stuy it:
  -2,000 people were killed
  -A description of the eruption was written down by Pliny the Younger
  -Pompeii was buried under ~20 feet of ash and lost from history for 1500 years, but was preserved by the ash and dug out
  -The ash preserved the forms of the dead

Mount Vesuvius is a stratovolcano formed by a subduction zone along the northeast coast of Italy

Mount Vesuvius is one of the most active volcanoes in the world.
  -People ran from an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 3580 B.C, leaving these footprints in fossilized ash.
  -It has erupted more than 50 times in the last 25,000 years
  -US B-25 Vomvers passed close to Mt. Vesuvius during its latest eruption
  -Erupted 79AD ******************************* REMEMBER THIS

Pompeii was rediscovered in 1599, and voer the past 250 years the ash been removed to reveal an ancient society

On the second da of the eruption, super hot toxic clouds of gas and debris blasted down the slopes of
  Vesuvius an overwhelmed Pompeii, killing everyone who had not left yet

Preserved for All Time
  -The gas clouds were hot enough to kill -but not burn- the bodies
  -The bodies burned in time-hardened ash eventually decayed, leaving hollow spaces
  -When found, these spaces were filed with plaster to form casts of the victims at the moment of their deaths

Plinian eruptions are named after Pliny the Younger, who wrote down an incredible account
  of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii

The destruction of Pompeii inspired many artists and writers

Bulwer-Lytton's novel inspired an Italian silent movie, considered to be the first important historical epic fimed on a grand scale
50 years later a depiction of Pompeii's destruction is more elaborate, but still a bit understated

In-Class Question

How do we measure how big an explosive eruption is relative to others?
  A By the volume of lava
  B By the volume of ash and other rock
  C By the size of the explosive crater
  D By the number of fatalities

Answer: B

Naples today sits at the foot of a sleeping giant

Yellowstone: A hidden supervolcano
  -Yellowstone has had three extremely large eruptions in the past 2.1 million years,
     ranging from 280 to 2500 times bigger than the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption

Hot-Spot volcanism
  -Hot buoyant mantle plumes rise from the core/mantle boundary
  -Plumes melt when they get near the surface(depressurized melting)
  -The motion of the plates over stationary hotspots leads to a chain of volcanoes

The hawaiian islands are at the end of a long chain of hotspot volcanoes
The hawaiian islands are an age-prograssive hot spot track

One explanation is called the Mantle Plume Model
Most hotspot tracks are in the oceans

Yellowstone & Snake-River Plain Volcanism is a age-prograssive track of volcanism
  -The mantle plume model only works if the North America plate has been moving southwestward over a mantle

In-Class Question

How do we know Hawaiian volcanoes are from hotspot volcanism?
  A From the size of its past eruptions
  B Because they are located above an ancient subducted slab and not a hot spot
  C Because they consist of a chain of age progressive volcanoes
  D All of the above

Answer: C

Yellowstone geysers and hot springs are fueled by heat from an enormous reservoir of magma beneath

Features of the entire system
  -Sinking cold water
  -Rising hot water heated by deep magma chamber
  -Hot springs nearby
  -The geyser

Geysers are fed by a plumping system with lots of bends where pressure builds

A caldera is a large circular depression formed when he surface collapses into an emptied magma chamber
Though associated with very large explosive eruptions, cleras are much bigger than an eruption crater

Crater Lke in Oregon is a caldera that formed when Mount Mazama erupted 7,700 years ago (VEI 7)
  7th Deepest lake in the world

Calderas are evidence that a major eruption has taken place (usually VEI 7 or 8)

Greece's Santorini islands surround the caldera that collapsed after the 
  Minoan eruption 3500 years ago that wiped out the Minoan civilization

Yellowstone has three calderas, indicating three very large eruptions in te past 2.1 million years (not necessarily super eruptions)

Because of erosion and their size, the Calderas at Yellowstone are difficult to distinguish

In-Class Question

A caldera forms when a volcanic eruption blows off the top of a volcano.
  A True
  B False

Answer: False

Comparison of ashfalls from Mt. St. Hellens (VEI 5) and Yellowstone's past 3 eruptions (2 VEI 8 Eruptions)
About 50% of the US was covered by ash during one of the supereruptions

Yellowstones magma chamber has been imaged by measuring the change in speed of seismic waves as they pass under the park

GPS measured vertical surface displacements at Yellowstone 
GPS also measure horizontal displacements

Aside from significant ash fallout, the other major danger of large volcanic eruptions is sustained global cooling
  -Explosive eruptions emit large amounts of ash and SO2
  -SO2 reacts with oygen and waer vapor to create sulfuric acid droplets
  -Sulfuric Acid droplets following laarge explosive volcanic erupptions can cause longer sustained global cooling than volcanic ash.

Euption of Mt. Pinatubo, Phillipines, 1991
  -VEI 6, 10 cubic km of ash
  -1000 people perished
  -Ash coud reached 700km across -- eventually reaching 1200 km across

Mt Pinatubo eruption causing global cooling og -.5C for a year

The 1815 Tambora eruption caused ~1C global cooling, triggering a significantly cooler summer and a shorter growing season
  -VEI 7, Heard 1500 miles away
  -Eruptive column 45 km tall
  -0,000 perished from pyroclastic flows and ash fallout (starvation and disease)

The Toba caldera supereruption in Sumatra 74,000 years ago
  -Lead to global cooling that almost wiped out humanity

Observations from ice cores suggest that ash from Toba caused a mini ice-age
This ice age appears to have reuced the human population to onl ~10,000 and maybe only 1000 mating pairs

The last known supereruption produced the Lake Taupo caldera in New Zealand

In-Class Question

If a supereruption happened today at Yellowstone, what would be the likely consequence?
  A Hundreds of people would die due to pyroclastic flows
  B Thousands of people would die due to ash fallout
  C Millions of people would die due to global cooling
  D All of the above

Answer: D

Supereruptions are not the only global volcanic danger: Giant flood basalts may have been responsible for mass extinctions
  -Lava flows with volumes 1000s of times those of ordinary eruptions
  -A single flor of over 1000km^3 can occur over a period of a few years
  -For comparison: Kilauea on Hawaii has produced just 1.5km^3 in 16 years

Giant flood basalts may have resulted from plume eads reaching the surface

Columbia flood basalt

A stack of about 20 Columbia River Basalt lava flows in the canyon of the Grande Ronde River, Washington State.
  -Each flow is 15-20cm thick

Flood Basalt ages often correspond with major extinction events
