Unit 9 Space Exploration

Movie: The Martian

Nov1--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solar System (closest to sun to farthest)
  -Terrestrial Planets(rock), Asteroids, Gas giants, Ice giants, Objects(mostly ice, some rock)

The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System

The innet planets are much closer to the Sun than the outer planets

The perfect solar eclipse by our moon is unique in the Solar SYSTEM. It is an amazing coincedence

Mercury
  -rotates very slowly: It takes Mercury 176 earth days(2 mars years) to complete one day/night cycle
  -Mercury's day/night terminus moves at a leisurely walking pace of only 2mph

Venus
  -Covered in dense clouds
  -Radar reveals topography of Venus
  -Atmospheric Pressure on the surface is 90times greater than on Earth
  -Venus' atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid
  -Strong greenhouse effects traps so much heat from the Sun that Venus has the hottest surface of any planet,
    reaching 465C or 860F, hotter than mercury
  -Winds reach 300 km/hr
  -The entire surface is covered with lava and volcanoes (more than any other planet)
  -Yes, there is lightning

Mars
  -We have recently discovered seasonal water (better described as dampness) on the surface.
    It is likely very salty, otherwise it would freeze
  -Billions of years ago there was a lot of water on Mars
    -Mars has any ancient river channels
  -Where there is water, we think there may be life
  -If we are able to find signs of life on Mars, current of ancient, it will come from closely examining the surface
  
InSight(Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Trandport) Landed on Mars Nov26 2018
  -Designed to study the deep interior of the planet
  -Has a seismometer
  -Heat probe
  -Numerous other sensors, like wind speed

Mars has some of them ost amazing topography in the Solar System
  -Tallest mountain (Mt Olympus) in Solar System
  -The low topography of the northern hemisphere may have been caused by a giant
  impact and may have been an ocean basin
  -Valles Marineris is the longest, widest, and deepest canon in the Solar System
  -Created bt a giant impact, the 7-km-deep Hallas Basin is the deepest Basin in the Solar System

The Face on Mars is a rick of the lighting conditions and poor photo resolution

Jupiter
  -The Great Red Spot is a giant storn on Jupiter that has existen for at least 300 years,
    Since cassini first viewed it with telescope
    -It is shrinking

Saturn
  -The rings consist of small water ice particles rangin in size from dust to meters
  -Saturn's rings average only ~10m in thickness

Surprise! All the giant planets have rings, but, except for Saturn, they are all 100times
  dimmer than the planet, aking them difficult to see.
  -These rings are all thought to have been generated by impacts.

Saturns Moon Titan
  -Second largest moon in the Solar System(bigger than Mercury)
  -The only moon in the Solar System to have a dense atmosphere
  -The only object in our Solar System other than Earth with rain, snows, lakes, and rivers
  -But it is too cold for water - the liquid is methane

In 2005, the Huygens spacecraft passed through Titan's thick stosphere and landed,
  enabling us to view its surface for the first time.

Pluto

In 2015, the New Horizons Spacecraft gave us out first clear veiw of Pluto
Why isnt it a planet?
Pluto is apast of the Kuiper Belt: one of millions of ice objects

Over 1 thousnad more Kuiper Belt ojects have been found, many of similar size.

Since Pluto has not cleared its orbit of similar-sized objects, it is not considered a planet, but a dwaft planet.

Jupiters moon Europa is thought to have a subsurface ocean

On Europa: Icebergs are evidence for thin ice and a warm subsurface water

Saturn's moon Enceladus
  Enceladus erupted water that freezes and feeds Saturn's E-Ring
  Encladus has water geyers, revealing the existence of a subsurface ocean

Launched the 1970s, the 4 Pioneer and Voyager soacecraft explored the outer planets and then headed outside the solar system.
The both carry a plaque in the hope that they would be read by alines

The Golden record: The Sounds of Earth

Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI)

A distributed computing project in which volunteers donate idle computer power to analyze radio signals.

The planet hunting Kepler Telescope

Kepler identified planets crossing their stars by the slight dimmings on the star's light

Transits of Venus are rare, coming in pairs that are 8 yeras apart but seperated over a century 
  The most recent transits were in 2004 and 2012, adn the n ext transit pair wil occur in 2117 and 2125

Kepler discovered more than 2300 exoplanets

Habitable Zone, a place where liquid can exist on the surface

So how many Earth-Like planets are out there?
  -Our milky awy galaxy has at least 100 billion starts
  -There are an estimated trillion galaxies, leading to a totl of 10^23 starts for every grain of sand on earth
  -An estimated 5% of those stars our like our sun, or 5000 billion sun-like stars
  -An estimated 20% of those starts have Earth-like planets, so there are 1000billion potentially
    habitable planets out there for every grain of sand in the world
  -If only 1 in a billion of thse habitable planets actually developed life, there are a trillion planets out there with life
  
Hazards of Space Travel

A long period of weightlessness will cause muscles to atrophy, bones to become brittle, and as of yet unknown other effects

Weightlessness can be countered by generating a centrifugal force by spinning a spacecraft

The spinning of a spacecraft does not actally create a gravity field: Object not moving 
  with the rotating surface will not eperience any downward force

Micrometeoroids
 -Fast moving tiny rocks that can damage spacecraft and harm astronauts

The radiation occured with solar flares can actually be very dangerous to astronauts and spacecraft

A solar flare (prominence) is a sudden, large enrgy release from the Sun consisting of clouds of energetic particles and radiation.

Space Junk

There are over 500,000 peices of space junk traveling at speeds of up to 17,500 miles per hour orbiting the Earth

Failure sequence: the aft joint failed upon ingition, but it took 70 seconds to burn the strut attaching the booster to the external tank

Main reasons why the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded:
  -THe program was aware of and ignored the implications of O-ring damage on numerous recovered booster hardware
  -The launch never took place under cold consitions that have never been testing
  -Managers at NASA adn contractor Morton Thiokol ignored the advice of engineers that is wasnt safe to launch

The Space Shuttle Columbia (2003) disintegrated during reentry, killing all 7 crew members.
  Foam from the external tank had broken off and damaged tiles on the orbiter wing.
