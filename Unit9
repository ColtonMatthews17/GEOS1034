Unit 9 Space Exploration

Movie: The Martian

Nov1--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solar System (closest to sun to farthest)
  -Terrestrial Planets(rock), Asteroids, Gas giants, Ice giants, Objects(mostly ice, some rock)

The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System

The innet planets are much closer to the Sun than the outer planets

The perfect solar eclipse by our moon is unique in the Solar SYSTEM. It is an amazing coincedence

Mercury
  -rotates very slowly: It takes Mercury 176 earth days(2 mars years) to complete one day/night cycle
  -Mercury's day/night terminus moves at a leisurely walking pace of only 2mph

Venus
  -Covered in dense clouds
  -Radar reveals topography of Venus
  -Atmospheric Pressure on the surface is 90times greater than on Earth
  -Venus' atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid
  -Strong greenhouse effects traps so much heat from the Sun that Venus has the hottest surface of any planet,
    reaching 465C or 860F, hotter than mercury
  -Winds reach 300 km/hr
  -The entire surface is covered with lava and volcanoes (more than any other planet)
  -Yes, there is lightning

Mars
  -We have recently discovered seasonal water (better described as dampness) on the surface.
    It is likely very salty, otherwise it would freeze
  -Billions of years ago there was a lot of water on Mars
    -Mars has any ancient river channels
  -Where there is water, we think there may be life
  -If we are able to find signs of life on Mars, current of ancient, it will come from closely examining the surface
  
InSight(Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Trandport) Landed on Mars Nov26 2018
  -Designed to study the deep interior of the planet
  -Has a seismometer
  -Heat probe
  -Numerous other sensors, like wind speed

Mars has some of them ost amazing topography in the Solar System
  -Tallest mountain (Mt Olympus) in Solar System
  -The low topography of the northern hemisphere may have been caused by a giant
  impact and may have been an ocean basin
  -Valles Marineris is the longest, widest, and deepest canon in the Solar System
  -Created bt a giant impact, the 7-km-deep Hallas Basin is the deepest Basin in the Solar System

The Face on Mars is a rick of the lighting conditions and poor photo resolution

Jupiter
  -The Great Red Spot is a giant storn on Jupiter that has existen for at least 300 years,
    Since cassini first viewed it with telescope
    -It is shrinking

Saturn
  -The rings consist of small water ice particles rangin in size from dust to meters
  -Saturn's rings average only ~10m in thickness

Surprise! All the giant planets have rings, but, except for Saturn, they are all 100times
  dimmer than the planet, aking them difficult to see.
  -These rings are all thought to have been generated by impacts.

Saturns Moon Titan
  -Second largest moon in the Solar System(bigger than Mercury)
  -The only moon in the Solar System to have a dense atmosphere
  -The only object in our Solar System other than Earth with rain, snows, lakes, and rivers
  -But it is too cold for water - the liquid is methane

In 2005, the Huygens spacecraft passed through Titan's thick stosphere and landed,
  enabling us to view its surface for the first time.

Pluto

In 2015, the New Horizons Spacecraft gave us out first clear veiw of Pluto
Why isnt it a planet?
Pluto is apast of the Kuiper Belt: one of millions of ice objects

Over 1 thousnad more Kuiper Belt ojects have been found, many of similar size.

Since Pluto has not cleared its orbit of similar-sized objects, it is not considered a planet, but a dwaft planet.
