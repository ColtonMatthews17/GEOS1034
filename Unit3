Movie Aftershock(2010): https://www3.123movies.la/movie/aftershock-1-ykw06py

1976 M7.8 Tangshan, China Earthquake
  -Official death toll of 240,000 - maybe many more

Why were the casualties so high?
  -Population of Tangshan > 5 million in 1976
  -Earthquake occured at 3:00am when most people were asleep inside buildings
  -Took two days before outside help arrived
  -No foreign assistance allowed by Chairman Mao

M7.0 January 2010 Haiti Earthquake
  - Death toll > 200,000 people estimated to have died.

The 1976 Tangshan and 2010 Haiti earthquakes were amongst the deadliest earthquakes in the past century.

If we are to prevent tragedies such as the Tangshan and Haiti earthquakes,
  it would be very helpful to be able to predict when and where an earthquake is going to over.

QUIZ

Earthquakes can be predicted with considerable accuracy
Answer: False

In a perfect world...  
  -Faults would be seadily loaded
  -Earthquakes would occer at the same stress level
  -Earthquakes would all be the same magnitude
    -Earthquakes would repeat like clockwork

In a less perfect world...
  -Faults would be steadily loaded
  -Earthquakes would occer at the same stress level
  -Earthquakes would not be the same magnitude
    -Earthquakes would occer at different times, but would still be predictable

**Picture**

In the real world...
  -Faults are generally steadily loaded
  -Earthquakes do not occure at the same stress level
  -Earthquakes are not the same magnitude
    -Earthquakes are not predictable
      One more problem: we can't even easily measure stresses in the Earth!

We can use historic earthquakes to estimate the probability of future eathqakes
That is the best we can do

Our best chance of predicting earthquakes lies in discovering a precursor: an observerable process that always precedes an earthquake

Possible earthquake precursors

QUIZ

Which of the following has proved to be a reliable earthquake precursor?
  a. Foreshocks
  b. Surface deformation near faults
  c. Water well level changes
  d. There are no reliable earthquake precursors

Answer: d

Foreshocks are smaler earthquakes that SOMETIMES ovver before a much bigger mainshock.

Some big earthquakes are precedented by a swarm of smaller earthquakes
MOST are not

The 2011 Tohoku earthqake has no identifiable foreshocks, but plenty of aftershocks
Italy sent seismologists to jail for not predicting the 2009 M6.3 L'Aquila earthquake based on foreshocks 
  (their conviction was eventually overturned)

Sep16-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When should a seismologist go public with an earthquake prediction?
  never lol

Quiz 3
Why are earthquakes so difficult to predict?
  a. Because there are no reliable precursors
  b. Because we dont know how much stress is required to initiate an earthquake
  c. Because we cant measure stress in the Earth to see what is happening on faults
  d. All of the above

Answer: d, all of the above

We can use historic earthquakes to estimate the probability of future earthquakes
That is the best we can do

GPS measurements enable us to measure slip deficit rates, which in turn enable us to predict how big an earthquake is likely to be.
**Picture**
  The steeper the gradient / the bigger the step, the faster the stress is accumulating on the fault

Knowing the slip deficit rate and the time since the last earthquake enables one to forecast the potential size of the next earthquake
  Slip deficit on the Enriquillo fault = 6mm / year 
  Last major earthquake = 250 years
  Accumulated slip deficit: 6mm/year * 250 years = 1.5m of slip
  1.5 m of slip corresponds to ~ M7.2 earthquake (on the graph in picture)
  This chart does not tell us that is could potentiall be two smaller earthquakes instead of one larger one aswell
  **Picture**

Forecast of the potential for a M7.2 earthquake in southern Haiti in 2008
  A M7.0 eathquake occured in that region in 2010

There is no direct relationship between Magnitude of earthquake and casualties
  Ex: 2003 M6.6 Iran cause 31,000 to die
  Ex: 2005 M7.6 Pakistan caused 80,000 to die
  Ex: 2015 M7.8 Nepal caused 9,000 to die
  Ex: 2008 M7.9 Wenchuan caused 87,000 to die

The biggest earthquakes are not necessarily the most dangerous

Biggest Earthquakes
  -Largest stress build up
  -Largest faults

Deadliest Earthquakes
  -Largest populations
  -Bad building practices

Since we cant predict earthquakes, we need to mitigate the death and destruction that usually results
  -Educate the public about earthquake hazards (School)
  -Do not build near active fauts, especially on loose soils
  -Develop earthquake early warning systems

What should you do in an earthquake?
  -If indoors is a well engineered building
    -Stay indoors
    -Drop to the ground; take cover under a table
    -Stay away from glass and anything that could fall
    -Use a doorway for shelter only if you know it is a strongly supported, loadbearing doorway
    -DO NOT use the elevators (or anything mechanical really)
  -If indoors in a poorly constructed building
    -Get out of the building as fast as possible
  -If outdoors
    -Move away from buildings

Quiz 4

If you are inside a building during an earthquake, should you try to get out?
  a. Yes
  b. No
  c. It depends on the surrounding of the building, how well the building is construced, and the size of the earthquake

Answer: c

Once surface waves arrive, poorly constructed buildings fall fast

Quiz 4

Once surface waves arrive, about how long does it take for poorly constructed buildings to collapse?
  a. A couple of seconds
  b. 10-20 seconds
  c. At least a minute
  d. Buildings only collapse after shaking stops

Answer: a

Building practices can determine who lives and who dies
2008 M8.3 Wenchuan, China eatthquake killed 87,000
Over 7000 poorly built schools collapsed, killing perhaps 10,000 sutdents
Brave police officers were able to save several children before a landslide came through

Concrete floors are incredily heavy and without proper steel reinforcement and lateral support can lead a building to "pancake" during an earthquake

Diagonal beams provide resistance to shearing that often causes buildings to collapse

Sep18---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removal of walls weakens a building
  -Dont put a ton of windows in a building, they will collapse

Adding corner joints make a building so much more stable, lessens te effects of earthquakes and can save lives

Tall buildings are not this unsage
  No catastrophic damage should occur to buildings built to earthquake codes that appropriately anticipate maximum shaking

Could the Space Needle fall over during an earthquake?
  No, the Space Needle is anchored by a strong foundation
    -Its foundation is 30ft deep, 120 feet across and was filled with 467 truck loads of steel reinforced concrete

Buildings can fall over during an earthquake if not properly anchored

Buildings can fall over during an earthquake due to liquefaction, where shaking tempoarily turns wet sediment into a fluid

The solution to that issue is to have super deep Pilings,
  so that the Pilings are not being shaken by the sediments, but are now anchored by the bedrock

Structures can collapse during an earthquake if they sway too much.

Forced Resonance: When the frequency of an external force matches the natural frequency of a structure, the structure will swing wildly
  The collapse of the Tecoma Narrows bridge in 1940 from wind induced forced resonance

Why did these buildings not sway too much during the 2011 Tohoju Japan

Approches to reducing the swaying of buildings Isolated and Inertial damping systems

Isolated  *************************WATCH VIDEO TO FIND DEFINITION*****************************
Internal Damping Sytem is such that within the building itself is has aa damping mechanism,
  within the building it has a hanging weight, counterbalancing the weight of building during shaking


Earthuake Early Warning System
  Concept: Seismic waves trave slower than the speed of light
           Therefore, one can detect an earthquake and communicate a warning ahead of the shaking


Surface rupture, disease, and fire can all result from earthquakes. -Be Prepared

TEST Review

Heat in the earth formed from MULTIPLE COLLISIONS that made the young earth how enough to melt its interior,
  allowing heavy minerals (iron and nickel) to MOVE TO THE CENTER / SINK INTO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH

The earths inner core is under too much PRESSURE to be liquid
  -The inner core cant be liquid because of the pressure

The lithosphere is comprised of CRUST and uppermost mantle. It comprises the tectonic plates.

Plate Tectonics: Cold strong float over warm weak ASTHENOSPHERE

What is this major tectonic feature called?
  A subduction zone

What is GPS used for in studying the Earth?
  -Deformation that occurs in the surface
  -Tectonic movement
  -Stress build up deforms the earth, before elastic rebound

What kind of plate boundary is this (Mid-Atlantic Ridge)
  -Divergent

Plate tectnics is driven by matle convection (tractions), forces from gravitational potential energy, and slab pull
  Convection is the process by which heat is transferred into a liquid
  slab pull is when a slab of lithosphere is being subducted under another plate and that slab gets pulled by gravitational pot. energy

Alfred Wegener's evidence for continental drift.
  Fossil evidence, configuration of plate boundaries, and similar geologic features.
  What is the mechanism that finally confirmed Alfred Wegener'stheory that he id NOT know about?
    -Sonar found mid-ocean ridges. 

Is the margin between oceanic curst and continental rust always a plate boundary?
  -No

On average, how fast do tectonic plates move?
  -1 inch a year

Could plate tectonics have influenced evolution?
  -Yes

Why do we need 4 satelited to get a position?
  -Because there are the 3 planes (xyz) and time. Longitude, Latitude, Height, and Time

The earths magnetic field arises from the MOVEMENT OF OUTER CORE AROUND INNER CORE

Waht does this evidence tell us about the earth? (layers of lava that are oriented to different poles)
  -The Earths poles has shifted in the past. (North becomes South and vice versa)
    -No evidence of mass extinction when poles switch

What is the main inredient in the formation fo Geodes?
  -Mineral rich water

How do we know the Earth is not hollow?
  Lbratory experiments show that rocks are too weak at the high tempuratues and pressure in Earths interior to support cuids
  the passage of seismic waves show to voide
  the magnitude of our grvity requires a dense solid, dense interior to our planer
  there is no known physics to buil a hollow planet **FILL IN LATER WITH VIDEO**
