Movie Aftershock(2010): https://www3.123movies.la/movie/aftershock-1-ykw06py

1976 M7.8 Tangshan, China Earthquake
  -Official death toll of 240,000 - maybe many more

Why were the casualties so high?
  -Population of Tangshan > 5 million in 1976
  -Earthquake occured at 3:00am when most people were asleep inside buildings
  -Took two days before outside help arrived
  -No foreign assistance allowed by Chairman Mao

M7.0 January 2010 Haiti Earthquake
  - Death toll > 200,000 people estimated to have died.

The 1976 Tangshan and 2010 Haiti earthquakes were amongst the deadliest earthquakes in the past century.

If we are to prevent tragedies such as the Tangshan and Haiti earthquakes,
  it would be very helpful to be able to predict when and where an earthquake is going to over.

QUIZ

Earthquakes can be predicted with considerable accuracy
Answer: False

In a perfect world...  
  -Faults would be seadily loaded
  -Earthquakes would occer at the same stress level
  -Earthquakes would all be the same magnitude
    -Earthquakes would repeat like clockwork

In a less perfect world...
  -Faults would be steadily loaded
  -Earthquakes would occer at the same stress level
  -Earthquakes would not be the same magnitude
    -Earthquakes would occer at different times, but would still be predictable

In the real world...
  -Faults are generally steadily loaded
  -Earthquakes do not occure at the same stress level
  -Earthquakes are not the same magnitude
    -Earthquakes are not predictable
      One more problem: we can't even easily measure stresses in the Earth!

We can use historic earthquakes to estimate the probability of future eathqakes
That is the best we can do

Our best chance of predicting earthquakes lies in discovering a precursor: an observerable process that always precedes an earthquake

Possible earthquake precursors

QUIZ

Which of the following has proved to be a reliable earthquake precursor?
  a. Foreshocks
  b. Surface deformation near faults
  c. Water well level changes
  d. There are no reliable earthquake precursors

Answer: d

Foreshocks are smaler earthquakes that SOMETIMES ovver before a much bigger mainshock.

Some big earthquakes are precedented by a swarm of smaller earthquakes
MOST are not

The 2011 Tohoku earthqake has no identifiable foreshocks, but plenty of aftershocks
Italy sent seismologists to jail for not predicting the 2009 M6.3 L'Aquila earthquake based on foreshocks 
  (their conviction was eventually overturned)
