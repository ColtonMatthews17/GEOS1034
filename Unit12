Unit12: Global Warming

Average global tempuratures have risen more than 1 degree Celcius relative to the late 19th century average
  Rate of tempurature increase at any time is 10 times faster than at any time in Earths past 800,000 years

Thermohaline circulation: Ocean currents of shallow, warm, salty water and deep, cold, less salty water

The tempurature of our atmosphere results from four key sources:
  -Solar energy: how much light we are getting from the sun
  -Greenhouse gasses: how much heat is being trapped by our atmosphere
  -Aerosols: particles in the atmosphere that block light and thus cause cooling 
  -Albedo: how much light is being reflected or absorbed by a surface 

While tempurature over the last 20 years have increased, the amount of energy the Earth has recieved from the Sun has decreased

Our eyes can only see a very narrow range of the full light spectrum

The surface of the Earth converts visible light from the sun into infrared light (heat)

The greenhouse effect works by converting visible light to heat (longwave radiation)

In our atmosphere, greenhouse gases allow visible light to pass, but trap some of the re-admitted radiation in the atmophere

Greenhouse gasses are required for the warm tempurate climate that has allowed life to florish on Earth

Humans have added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere causing more heat to be trapped and tempuratues to rise.

Humans can have a significant influence on greenhouse gases (like CO2) because they account for only a tiny fraction of our atmosphere

Over the past 100 years, the average annual emissions of CO2 from humans is 150x more than the CO2 emissions from volcanoes

Coal-fired power plants are the largest contributors of CO2. A single coal-fired power plant can use 10,000 tons of coal per day
  -the amount carried by a 100 car train

Aerosols are any small particles suspended in the atmosphere that block sunlight - thus causing cooling

Aerosols are both produced by humans and volcanoes

Human sources of aerosols can result from burning fossil fuels

In theory, cleaning up vehicle ehaust can increase global tempuratures
  BUT the greenhouse gases cased y these cars outweigh the aerosols

Albedo is the capacity of a surface to reflect light
 Low albedo: ocean water reflects 10% of sunlight and converts 90% to heat
 High albedo: ice relects 90% of sunlight and converts only 10% to heat

Melting of ice leads to more surface water, lowering global albedo

There have been large changes in tempurature that have occured throughout Earth's history due to changes in Earth orbital parameters

These long-term changes are due to Milankovic Cycles
  Earths tilt and eccentricity, and wobble/precession

The disintegration of the Larsen Ice Shelf really happened- but ice cores are never taken from ice shelves as they are thin and thus
  do not go very far back in time.

Ice cores enable us to understand the relationship between past tempuratures and greenhouse gas concentrations
  They also show us that temperatures and CO2 concentrations are always closely correlated

Over the past 100 years, levels of CO2 have climbed much faster and much higher than at any time in the past 800,000 years

The correlation between current increasing tempuratures and greenhouse gases is compelling

Scientists build numerical models that simulate the physics of environmental variables

Atmospheric models lead to the unequivocal conclusion that human emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible for the current
  rise in global tempuratures

Global warming causes climate change

Global Warming refers to the ongoing rise in global average tempuratures

Climate Change refers changes in climate: hotter/cooler, wetter/dryer,
  frequency and severity of storms brought about from globl warming

Weather: the condition in the atmosphere at a particular place and time: temp, pressure, humidity, precipitation, and wind
Climate: average weather over a broad area averaged over a long time period

Unusually warm weather in the arctic pushes unusually cold weather to the south.

Climate change is here

The 2012-2017 California drought was the driest in California history (over 100mil died)

Some of the state came out of the drought due to record rain falls
  2018 was the most destructive wildfire season on record in California

The number of hot and extremely hot days have jumped dramitically compared to pre 2980
Hot day: temp more than 10F above seasonal average
Extremely hot day: temp more than 20F above seasonal average

Higher tempuratures mean more water evaporates leading to more storms and flooding

Global warming is causing glaciers to dissapear world-wide

The Ilulissat Glacier in Greenland has retreated as much as in the past 10 years as it did in the previous 100 years

Arctic Summer sea ice has been reduced by 50% over the past 60 years and could completely disappear in the next 30-40 years

Net antartic ice is also being lost at a fast pace, though the distribution of change is not uniform

Confirmation Bias: The urge to believe only things that confirm what you already believe to be true.

Backfire Effect: Instead of embracing the truth, many belieers double down on their beliefs after being presented with evidence
  that contradicts them
  
Effective tipping point: Motivated Readoners start to accept hard truths

Paris Climate Accord
  -Each country determines, plans, and regulately reports its own contribution it should make in order to mitigate global warming
  -There is no mechnism to force a country to set a specific target by a specific date
  -All existing countries signed on to do what they can to help except for one

Legimate debate on climate change exists on three major fronts:
  -How should we balance enironmental and economic concerns?
    Climate change is already costing our economy
    Each year we have to recover from an ever increasing number of large scale climate change influenced disasters
  -How much will the Earth heat up?
    
  -What are the best strategies to fight global warming?
    
kinda stopped taking notes
