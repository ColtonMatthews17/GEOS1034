Global Positioning Systm Instruments measure the following to obtain velocities and positions:
  1. longitude
  2. latitude
  3. height
  4. time
Four satellites are needed to solve for all 4 variables

Elastic Rebound in action in Japan
Quiz 1
1. Prior to the 2011 Japan earthwuake, subduction of the PacificnPlate was pushing Japan to the west.
  In which direction did Japan move during the 2011 earthwuake?

A: To the east. During the 201 earthquake, elastic rebound caused Japan to move (rebound) to the east.

Three types of faults arise from three types of stress states
  1. Thrust Faulting
      -Compressional loading
      -Convergent plate coundaries like subduction zones
  2. Normal Faulting
      -Extensional loading
      -Divergent plate boundaries like mid-ocean ridges
  3. Strike-Slip faulting
      -Horizontal shear loading
      -Transform plate coundaries like San Andreas

Quiz 1
2. What kind of faults are these?
(PICTURE)

The subduction of the Indo-Australia plate beneath the Eurasian plate is accommodated by a megathrust fault (very large thrust fault)

Most common mistakes in earthquake movies: showing faults opening up
  Faults never open, the two sides always slide past each other

Two types of strike slip faults: left-lateral fault or a right-lateral fault
San Andreas is a right-lateral fault

Why do earthquakes cause shaking?
  -The rubbing of the two sides of a fault during an earthquakke generates seismic waves, like hands rubbed together make sound waves
  -Sound waves propagate outwards like water waves when a stone is dropped into a pond.

In addition to surface waves, earthquakes cause body waves that travel through the interior of the Earth.
  -No S-Waves travel through the outer core.
  -Both S and P-waves travel through the inner core, mantle, and crust.

Two types of body waves: 
  -P-waves: veritcal shaking
  -S-waves: horizontal shaking

Two types of surface waves:
  -Love waves: side to side rolling motion on the surface
  -Rayleigh waves: waves die out with depth. like waves in an ocean, like a circle.

P-waves (P for primary, or pressire)
  -A body wave that travels through the earth
  -Push-pull motion (compress then expand like a sound wave)
  -Fastest wave, first to feel after an earthquake
  -Travels through solids, liquids and gasses
  -Fastest seismic wave (first to arrive), but the weakest
    Slinkies are a good representation or p-waves

S-waves (S for secondary or shear)
  -A body wave that travels through the Earth
   -Side to side motion(shear)
   -Will not travel through liquids
   -Slower than p-waves
   -Sort of looks like the earth doing a wave (like the human arms do it)

Love waves
  -A surface wave that travels along the survace of the Earth
  -Side-to-side motion
  -Along with the rayleigh waves the are the last to arive but cause the most shaking
  -This is the most amaging because the energy is not beneath the surface; however, it is confined to the earths surface
  -Looks like a snake

Rayleigh Waves
  -A surface wave taht travles along the surface of the earth
  -Up-down motion like an ocean wave
  -Along with Love waves, they are last to arrive but cause the most shaking
  -Looks like an ocean wave. (Note the base was not moving)

Seismologists record seismic waves at seismic stations by using seismometers that roduce seismograms
Seismograms are a measure of ground motion during an earthquake

** SURFACE WAVES DO MOST DAMAGE

P and S wave arrival times can be used to located an earthquake
  They disparity in time between the arrival of p and s waves can determine distance from earthquake center
  You need at least 3 seismic stations to locate an earthquake

Seismic waves enable us to look into the earth
  -Scientists use them to map the interior of the earth

Seismic waves from any strong source (e.g shotgun) will be partially reflected by rocks with different densities
  and returned to the surface where they can be recorded

Reflection seismology allows visualization of curstl structure several kilometers down
Astronauts used seismic reflection using a similar strategy
Earthquake seismology uses reismic waves from earthquakes to visualize the Earths deep interior

p-waves can convert to s-waves, this is how s-waves get into inner core

Earthquake seismology can reveal subducting plates deep within the Earth
  -Faster wave velocity can reveal density of rocks under surface

An earthquake is assigned a magnitude based on the extent of area on the fault that slipped and the amount it slipped
Earthwuake magnitude is a logarithmic scale:
  For every whole number increase in magnitude the amplitude of shaking goes up by a factor fo 10
    Mag 7 is 100x stronger than Mag 5

Number of bigger earthquakes are much less than smaller earthquakes

The worlds largest earquakes occu along convergent plate boundaries (subduction zones) becasue rcok is strongest in compression
There is a limit to how big an earthquake can be (M10)
