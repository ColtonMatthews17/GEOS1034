Global Positioning Systm Instruments measure the following to obtain velocities and positions:
  1. longitude
  2. latitude
  3. height
  4. time
Four satellites are needed to solve for all 4 variables

Elastic Rebound in action in Japan
Quiz 1
1. Prior to the 2011 Japan earthwuake, subduction of the PacificnPlate was pushing Japan to the west.
  In which direction did Japan move during the 2011 earthwuake?

A: To the east. During the 201 earthquake, elastic rebound caused Japan to move (rebound) to the east.

Three types of faults arise from three types of stress states
  1. Thrust Faulting
      -Compressional loading
      -Convergent plate coundaries like subduction zones
  2. Normal Faulting
      -Extensional loading
      -Divergent plate boundaries like mid-ocean ridges
  3. Strike-Slip faulting
      -Horizontal shear loading
      -Transform plate coundaries like San Andreas

Quiz 1
2. What kind of faults are these?
(PICTURE)

The subduction of the Indo-Australia plate beneath the Eurasian plate is accommodated by a megathrust fault (very large thrust fault)

Most common mistakes in earthquake movies: showing faults opening up
  Faults never open, the two sides always slide past each other

Two types of strike slip faults: left-lateral fault or a right-lateral fault
San Andreas is a right-lateral fault

Why do earthquakes cause shaking?
  -The rubbing of the two sides of a fault during an earthquakke generates seismic waves, like hands rubbed together make sound waves
  -Sound waves propagate outwards like water waves when a stone is dropped into a pond.

In addition to surface waves, earthquakes cause body waves that travel through the interior of the Earth.
  -No S-Waves travel through the outer core.
  -Both S and P-waves travel through the inner core, mantle, and crust.

Two types of body waves: 
  -P-waves: veritcal shaking
  -S-waves: horizontal shaking

Two types of surface waves:
  -Love waves: side to side rolling motion on the surface
  -Rayleigh waves: waves die out with depth. like waves in an ocean, like a circle.

P-waves (P for primary, or pressire)
  -A body wave that travels through the earth
  -Push-pull motion (compress then expand like a sound wave)
  -Fastest wave, first to feel after an earthquake
  -Travels through solids, liquids and gasses
  -Fastest seismic wave (first to arrive), but the weakest
    Slinkies are a good representation or p-waves
