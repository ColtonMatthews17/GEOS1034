Unit 7: Wildfires

Movie: Planes: Fire and Rescue

Wildfire: A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire in an 
  area of combustible begetation that occurs in a wilderness area, such as a forest or grassland

3 components to produce fire: Oxygen, Heat / Ignition, Fuel

There are a variety of ways that humans cause wildfires
  -Arson
  -Smoking
  -Campfires
  -Equipment Fires
    -Ex: Lawnmower Sparks
  -Burning Debris
  -Lightning

Most wildfires are caused by humans, but fires started by lightning burn more acres

The potential for a wildfire to spread depends on the vegetation type, topography, and weather

Wildfire Weather
  -On any given day, weather conditions (ex: lightning, temp, humidiy, wind) influence that potential for a 
    wildfire to start and spread.

Surface Fires involve grasses, pines needles, and shrubs. 
  -The large surface area of these fuels allow them to burn easilt and spread very rapidly.

Crown Fires are those in which flames reach the canopies of tress.
  They are the hottest and fastest moving of all wildfires and are extremely difficult to fight,

A crown fire can burn out a large cluster of trees in less than a minutes

3 Phases of a wildfire:

  Preignition
    -Preheating: Heat of fuels causes them to lose moisture, making them more combustible
    -Pyrolysis: Heat causes fuel molecules to break down, making them more combustible
  
  Combustion
    -Heat is liberated through ignition of a chemical reaction between the fuel and oxygen
    -Released heat ignites new fuels, enabling the fire to spread.
  
  Smoldering
    -Non-burnable carbon and ash cover and hinder the burning of new fuels, eventually leading to extinction

Steep topography and strong winds cause fires to spread faster by directing flames to new fuels
  -Strong winds also carry burning embers (firebrands) that can start spot fires

The Great Fire of 1910
  -The largest wildfire in U.S. history burned 3 million acres in the northwest in two days.
  -Killed 87 people, including 78 firefighters

Ed Pulaski(1868-1931) was a Forest Service Ranger who save most of his 45-man hotshot crew during the Great Fire of 1910
  by forcing them to stay in a mine and not try to escape and out-run the fire

Ed Pulaki also invented what would be calle the Pulaki axe, a
  single-bladed axe with a prub-how for scraping the group clear that in now standard issue for all wildland firefighters

U.S. Forest Service's response to the 1910 wildfire was to create a polic to aggresively fight all wildfires

The idea of preventing and fighting all forest fires was sold to the public by Smokey the Bear

The consequence of aggresively fighting all wildfires is that you dont let smaller fires
  prevent the build-up of fuel(plants), this leading to much larger fires

The consequence of Smokey the Bear's actions: the yellowstone fire of 1988 was the largest in the Yellowstone Park's history,
  burning 38% of the park.

The Yellowstone fires were pushed by 80mph winds, threatening many historical park buildings

After 3 months of fire fighting sutility, the fire was finally put out by 1/4 inch of snow

In 1972, the Forest Service shifted its policy of fighting fires from suppression to mitigation and managemnet
  -Permite wildfires to burn in wilderness areas
  -Only fight fires that endanger people or important structures
Objectives:
  -Fuel reduction
  -Control of insects, diseases, and competing vegetation
  -Improvement of natrual ecosstems and wildlife habitat

Fire is required for the pinecones to germinate

Some cultures set fires to maintain grasslands and prevent trees and schrubs from taking over.
Grasses are able to survive fire because they grow from the bottom instead of the top.

Seasonal natural grassland wildfires (started by lightning) and those started by humans in Africa help maintain the grasslands
