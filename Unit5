Volcano structure and hazards

Magma chamber: a reservoir of magma within the earths crust beneath a volcano
  -Can be imaged with seismic waves

Volcanic Conduit: also known as a volcanic vent
  -Connects the magma chamber to the surface, Channel through which magma travels to the surface

Eruption cloud and column: a cloud of super-heated ash and tephra suspended in gases.
  -The volcanic materials form a column that may rise many kilometers into the air above the vent of the volcano

Pyroclastic flow: a fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter (collectively known as tephra)

Lahar: a violent type of mudflow or debris flow composed of a slurry of pyroclastic material, rocky debris, and water.

Lava: melted rock above the surface
Magma: melted rock below the surface

Magma occurs only in a few special places close to the surface where tempuratures and pressures are sufficient to melt rock
  -Much less than 1% of Earths crust and mantle is actually melted rock

Melting rock can be caused by either an increase in tempurature OR a decrease in pressure OR addition of water (decrease in metling tempurate)

There are three types of volcanism: subduction zone, hot-spot, and mid-ocean ridge

Volcanism is found mostly near plate boundaries (mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones)

On average, mid-ocean ridges account for 70% of all volcanism each year
  (It takes alot of magma to keep churcning out new oceanic crust)
  -Volcanism can heat up bodies of water very fast
  -Black smokers - the origin of life?
  
Hawaii owes its existence to hot spot volcanism

Most of the world's surface volcanoes are associated with subduction

Subduction zone volcanism occurs when subducting plates bring water molecules down into the mantle
  where it lowers the melting tempurature of already  hot rocks, enabling them to melt and then rise

Question 1

What does Dr. Barnes get wrong in this scene?
  A Earthquakes can cause volcanic eruptions
  B Volcanism can heat bodies of water fairly fast
  C Tectonic plates float on an ocean of molten rock
  D All of the above

Answer: C

The shape of a volcano and the likelihood of it erupting eplosively versus effucively (calmly) is dependent in part on the viscosity of the magma
  -Viscosity is a measure of how easily a fluid flows
    -Higher viscosity, faster flow, lower viscosity, slower flow
