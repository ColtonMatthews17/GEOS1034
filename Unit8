Unit8: Asteroids, Comets, and Impacts

Movie: Deep Impact

Oct25------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comets: A comet is an icy small Solar Sytem body that, when close to the sun, displays a visable
        coma (a thin, fuzzy, temporary atmosphere) and sometimes also a tail. These typically burn up in the Earth's atmosphere

Asteroids: Asteroids are a class of small Solar System bodies in orbit around the sun further awa than coments and don't have a coma.
           They can break-up into meteoroids and burn up in the Earth's atmosphere

Meteoroids: Small rocks (less than a few meters across) traveling thorugh space
Meteors: Small rocks from space that light up in the night sky as they burn up the Earths atmosphere
Meteorites: Small pieces of place rock that survive passage through the atmosphere to be pickedup on a planet surface. 
  Exist because meteroids burn in the Earth's atmosphere

Meteoroids are small rocky bodies that travel through space
Meteors are poduced when meteoroids burn up in the Earth's atmosphere and light up the sky (can be broken up asteroids),
  and meteorites are peices of these meteors that make it all the way down to the surface

A fragment of the 2013 Chelyabinsk Meteorite was recovered from the bottom of lake in Russia

Meteoritess are gifts of the aky as to what is out there. They come in 4 basic types: each with its own history of formation

Iron, Stony, Stony-Iron, Chondrites

93% of meteorites are made of stone
6% are made of iron
1% are stony-iron (also called pallasites)

The easiest place to find meteorites is Antartica, where the flowing glaciers collect and deposit them.
  And because they are dark they are easily seen on the ice

Martian meteorites are found on Earth
  -Martian meteorites are identifies from trapped gas bubbles that are identical in composition to Mars' atmospheres
  -They are though to have been ejected from Mars by large impacts

The lafayette meteorite was "discovered" in a collection of rocks at Purdue University

Asteroids are large space rocks that range in size from meters to 100s of kilometers
  -Asteroids have smooth surfaces due to a coating of regolith - ejecta fragments from many impacts

Asteroids, and other airless bodies, ten to have smooth surfaces because of regolith: layers of loose dust and small particles
  left over from many impacts

We find asteroids by time-exposure photos of the sky using ground and space based telescopes

There are more than half-million known asteroids and millions more to be discovered

Most asterpods reside in the asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter. Distance between them in ~500,000 km

But some asteroids orbit well inside Mars
Asteroids that orbit near Earth are called near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), or Near Earth Objects (NEOs)

There are an estimated 1 million asteroids bigger than 1km in diameter and billions of smaller ones

In 2017, we were visited by a rogue asteroid nont from our Solar System

It came through on a hyperbolic orbit based on the Sun's gravity and left
  - in other words, if it was a spacecraft, it never turned on its engines

The rogue asteroid was thought to be about a quarter-mile long, and about 10 times longer than it is wide.

Comets

Comets are dirty iceballs (micture of ice and rock) as old as the solar system itself.

Comet nuclei tend to be fairly small, generally only 10km across or less

As a comet approaches the Sun, solar radiation causes the ices to vaporize
  -The gas tail is composed of moleciles ionized by UV liht from the Sun, causeing it ot emit blue light
  -The gas tail is pushed directly away from the Sun by the solar wind (charged particles streaming form the Sun)

Dust jets from comet Tempel 1 contain ejected blocks ranging only up to 10s of centimeters

Dust jets do not turn on and off with sunrise and sunset They turn on sporatically and last for short time periods (10s of minutes).
  We are not sure why, aybe landslides push debris into invisible gas jets.

Cometary jets are very low pressure, but there is also not much graviyt, so we dont really know what will
  happen to that astronauts causght in a jet. But whatever it is, it will happen slowly

Comets lose mass with each pass of the sun. After too many passes, the fate of all comets is to break up. When this happens,
  comet debris continues along the same orbit, forming comet grouops, ntil the peices are eventually eaten up by the Sun.

Comet ISON's highly elliptical orbit around the Sun showed that it came from very far away

Meteor showers are created when the Earth passes through the remnants of broken up comet.

A comets gravity is several hundred thousand times smaller than Earth's 
  So how would you land a spacecraft on its surface without bouncing off?

The rosetta spacecraft dropped the Philae lander to the surface of Churymov-Gerasimeko, which deployed harpoons to grab it.

Unfortunately the harpoons didn't work and Philae bounced several times before settling near a cliff

Long-period comets come from the outer solar system, far beyond Pluto, and take 1000s of years to orbit the Sun

Short-period comets orbit much closer to the Sun n a matter of decades

Ultra-short-period comets (<10 years to orbit): Orbit extends only to Jupiter

Halley's Comet is the most famous comet because it is a short-period comet that comes into view about once in a lifetime (75 years)
  -The only short-period comet that is visible to the Naked eye
 -Last appeared in 1986, and will next appear in 2061
 -Its passage has been recorded since 240BC

Both the Kuiper Belt and yhe Oort Cloud are well beyond the ice line (which is inside Jupiters orbit), explaining why comets are Icy

We know that the Oort cloud is spherical because long-period comets come at us from all directions

In 2014 Comet Siding Spring came within 87,000 miles of Mars (1/3 the distance from Earth to the Moon)

Impacts

Its all about the speed: When an asteroid hits the Earth it is generally traveling ~ 15 km/s. 
  This causes asteroids to explode like a bomb on impact

Consequences of Asteroid Impacts behaving like explosions
  The resulting crater is 15-30 times bigger than the impactor
  Impact craters are almost always round

Ejecta (rock thrown out of the crater during impact) mostly lands within one diameter of the crater,
  though ejecta rays can extends 10s of crater diameters

There are three basic types oof craters based on size
  -Simple crater
    Just a circle
    Smallest
  -Complex Crater
    Has a central peak
  -Multi-ring basin
    Has seperate rings in the basin
    Largest

The complex Hershel crater on Saturns icy moon Mimas is the alrgest ratio of a crater diameter
  to the size of a moon or planet anyhere in the Solar System

Impact Breccia: angular shattered peices of rock surrounded by melt from impact

The multi-ring Valhalla Basin on Jupiter's icy moon Callisto is the margest impact basin in the Solar System (~3800km)

The very large dark circles on the Moon are big impact basins filled with lava (called mare)

The Moon is completely saturated with impact craters, meaning that any new crater and its ejecta partially covers older ones

NASA was so concerned about the first astronauts disappearing into the regolith upon landing,
  that the lunar lander was given big foot[rints and the astronauts big booties.

The 13km diameter Kentland Crater in Indiana is not easily identifiable because glaciers removed the surface topography 12,000 years ago

Inside a central peak
  The only place in Indiana where rock layers do not lie horizontally
  Shatter cones found throughout the quarry are evidence of a high pressure shock wave

Our Moon originated from the Impact of a Mars-sized planet (Theia) into earth 4.6 billion years ago

An impactor only 10km in diameter can cause mass extinctions

The extinction of the Dinosaurs was belived to have been caused by a 10-km diameter impactor 65 million years ago

The Cretaceous (Dinosaur-rule) Paleogene (Mammal ruled) extinction event occured 65 million years ago,
  killing of ~75% of all species on Earth

The thin layer of clay that seperates Cretaceous from Paleogene sediments all over the world contains a lot of iridium, shocked quartz,
  and soot, indicative of a giant impact and global fire.

In 1990, the 65 million year old, 180-km diameter Chicxulub crater was idenified, buried 1km under sediments off of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula

Chicxuub was revealed by mapping the gavity signiture and dated from cores drilled through the sediments

Oct30------------------------------------------------------------------------

The impact could have killed off the dinosaurs and 75% of other species in several ways
  -Heat of ejecta as it passes through the atmosphere woud cause global wildfires
  -Dust suspended in the atmosphere for years would block sunlight and cause global cooling
  -Ejecta would disrupt the oone layer leading to extensive radiation from the Sun
  -Sulfate-Righ marine rocks blasted into the atmosphere would have transformed into sulfuric acid that
    rained down on the oceans causing them to be very acidic

May asteroids cross Earths orbit

There are now over 18,000 knwon NEOs

Every year, ~50,000 tons of material falls on Eath from outer space

Kinetic impact: crash a heavy spacecraft into it to alter trajectory
Spacecraft propulasion: create a small sustained thrust on its side o alter trajectory
Focus solar heat onto a comet surface to create thrust from the resulting vaporization of material and alter tajectory
Solar sail: attach a large solar sail enabling solar pressure to shift the objects trajectory
Nuclear weapons: Direct hit to vaporize, Detonate a series of devices alongside to alter trajectory.
