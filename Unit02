Unit 2: Earthquakes

Largest Earthquakes:
  -Chile      1960, 9.5M, 11min
  -Alaska     1964, 9.2M, 5min
  -Sumatra    2004, 9.1M, 5min
  -Japan      2011, 9.0M, 6min
  -Kamchatka  1952, 9.0M, 4min

About 1.5 million earthquakes do occur around the glob each year,
  -Average 1 earthquake > 8 each year
  -15 above 7
  -134 above 6
  -1,319 above 5
  -13,000 above 4
  -130,000 above 3
  -1,300,000 above 2

2011 quake did move a portion of Japan 8 feet

The energy release from the 1964 alaska earthquake was more like 150,000 atom bombs

Hilo Hawaii was destroyed by a 35 foot high tsunami following the 1964 chile earthquake 6500 miles away.

We are probably overdue for an earthquake on the southern San Andreas Fault
  On average, large earhquakes recur on the San Andreas fault every 150 years.

An earthquake is a sudden break in the Earth's crust taht occurs after a long period of stress buildup due to motions of the tectonics plates.
  -Hypecenter is qhere the earthquakes starts (under earth)
  -Epicenter is point on the surface of the earth where the earthquake happens (directly aboce hypocenter)

Two processes describe the earthquake cycle:
  1. Elastic Rebound: The crust deforms elastically (storing energy), then rebounds (like a ball)
    a: Original position
    b: Deformation
    c: Rupture and release of energy
    d: Rocks rebound to original undeformed shape

  2. Stick-Slip Behavior: a fault remains locked while energy builds, then slips suddenly

Elastic Rebound ans stick slip behavior associated with a subduction zone earthquake

Stick-Slip behavior occurs because of friction:
  Rough spots along the fault (called asperities or protrusions) prevent the fault from sliding until they are broken

The San Francisco region is currently building stress on faults and elastic energy within the crust toward a large earthquake

Global Positioning System Instruments measure the following to obtain velocities and positions:
  1. longitude
  2. latitude
  3. height
  4. time
Four satellites are needed to solve for all 4 variables

Elastic Rebound in action in Japan
Quiz 1
1. Prior to the 2011 Japan earthwuake, subduction of the PacificnPlate was pushing Japan to the west.
  In which direction did Japan move during the 2011 earthwuake?

A: To the east. During the 201 earthquake, elastic rebound caused Japan to move (rebound) to the east.

Three types of faults arise from three types of stress states
  1. Thrust Faulting
      -Compressional loading
      -Convergent plate coundaries like subduction zones
  2. Normal Faulting
      -Extensional loading
      -Divergent plate boundaries like mid-ocean ridges
  3. Strike-Slip faulting
      -Horizontal shear loading
      -Transform plate coundaries like San Andreas

Quiz 1
2. What kind of faults are these?
(PICTURE)

The subduction of the Indo-Australia plate beneath the Eurasian plate is accommodated by a megathrust fault (very large thrust fault)

Most common mistakes in earthquake movies: showing faults opening up
  Faults never open, the two sides always slide past each other

Two types of strike slip faults: left-lateral fault or a right-lateral fault
San Andreas is a right-lateral fault

Why do earthquakes cause shaking?
  -The rubbing of the two sides of a fault during an earthquakke generates seismic waves, like hands rubbed together make sound waves
  -Sound waves propagate outwards like water waves when a stone is dropped into a pond.

In addition to surface waves, earthquakes cause body waves that travel through the interior of the Earth.
  -No S-Waves travel through the outer core.
  -Both S and P-waves travel through the inner core, mantle, and crust.

Two types of body waves: 
  -P-waves: veritcal shaking
  -S-waves: horizontal shaking

Two types of surface waves:
  -Love waves: side to side rolling motion on the surface
  -Rayleigh waves: waves die out with depth. like waves in an ocean, like a circle.

Sep9------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P-waves (P for primary, or pressire)
  -A body wave that travels through the earth
  -Push-pull motion (compress then expand like a sound wave)
  -Fastest wave, first to feel after an earthquake
  -Travels through solids, liquids and gasses
  -Fastest seismic wave (first to arrive), but the weakest
    Slinkies are a good representation or p-waves

S-waves (S for secondary or shear)
  -A body wave that travels through the Earth
   -Side to side motion(shear)
   -Will not travel through liquids
   -Slower than p-waves
   -Sort of looks like the earth doing a wave (like the human arms do it)

Love waves
  -A surface wave that travels along the survace of the Earth
  -Side-to-side motion
  -Along with the rayleigh waves the are the last to arive but cause the most shaking
  -This is the most amaging because the energy is not beneath the surface; however, it is confined to the earths surface
  -Looks like a snake

Rayleigh Waves
  -A surface wave taht travles along the surface of the earth
  -Up-down motion like an ocean wave
  -Along with Love waves, they are last to arrive but cause the most shaking
  -Looks like an ocean wave. (Note the base was not moving)

Seismologists record seismic waves at seismic stations by using seismometers that roduce seismograms
Seismograms are a measure of ground motion during an earthquake

** SURFACE WAVES DO MOST DAMAGE

P and S wave arrival times can be used to located an earthquake
  They disparity in time between the arrival of p and s waves can determine distance from earthquake center
  You need at least 3 seismic stations to locate an earthquake

Seismic waves enable us to look into the earth
  -Scientists use them to map the interior of the earth

Seismic waves from any strong source (e.g shotgun) will be partially reflected by rocks with different densities
  and returned to the surface where they can be recorded

Reflection seismology allows visualization of curstl structure several kilometers down
Astronauts used seismic reflection using a similar strategy
Earthquake seismology uses reismic waves from earthquakes to visualize the Earths deep interior

p-waves can convert to s-waves, this is how s-waves get into inner core

Earthquake seismology can reveal subducting plates deep within the Earth
  -Faster wave velocity can reveal density of rocks under surface

An earthquake is assigned a magnitude based on the extent of area on the fault that slipped and the amount it slipped
Earthwuake magnitude is a logarithmic scale:
  For every whole number increase in magnitude the amplitude of shaking goes up by a factor fo 10
    Mag 7 is 100x stronger than Mag 5

Number of bigger earthquakes are much less than smaller earthquakes

The worlds largest earquakes occu along convergent plate boundaries (subduction zones) becasue rcok is strongest in compression
There is a limit to how big an earthquake can be (M10)

The duration of shaking inreases with earthquake magnitude

To build a new San Francisco, the rubble from the old one was scraped into the bay,
  creating a new shoreline of a very unconsolidated nature.

Loose sediments amplify seismic shaking
The marina disrict, built on 1906 earthquake rubble, experienced some of the most intense shaking during the 1989 earthquake.

Sediments in the Santa Rosa Basin greatly magnified the amplitude and duration of shaking during the 1906 earthquake.

QUIZ Q

What is the difference between earthquake intensity and earthquake magnitude?
A: Intensity refers to the effects that earthquakes have, magnitude refers to energy released.

Mercalli Intensities: The shaking that people and buildings actually feel
  -Based on felt reports
  -Can be used to estimate the size of historic earthquakes

**picture of mercalli intensity scale**

Mercallle Intensities provide a means of estimating how destructive an earthquake was likely to be.
The 2001 M9.1 Sumatra earthquake (2.5 less shaking than a 9.5) was felt 2700 km away

For the same magnitude earthquake, shaking is felt further away in the eastern US compared to the western US
Shaking is more intense in the East because the crust is stronger (less active faults breaking it up) and transmits seismic energy better

Earthquakes occur in the Midwest/South (far from any plate boundaries) due to the reactivization of ancient faults
  The New Madrid Seismic Zone is thought to be the reactivization of an ancient failed rift system.

LIQUEFICATION: During the shaking of an earthquake, solids can act like liquids because the water is seperated from sand / dirt
                And allows little minerals to float.
