There are 4 layers to the earth: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.
  -The crust is a solid
  -The mantle is a solid
  -The outer core is liquid
  -The inner core is solid

Collisions cause motion to be converted into heat.
Heat from collisions made the young earth extremely hot, melting its interior, allowing heavy metals like iron and nickel to sink and form the core.
The sinking of metals of different densities is what created the earths layers.

Lithosphere is broken into 13 major plates and a bunch of smaller ones.

Tectonic plates are on the crust (surface of the earth)
Tectonic plates slide past each other in three ways:
  -Convergent: where they are moving towards each other, and in this scenario one goes underneath the other
  -Divergent: where two plates are moving away from each oter     
  -Transform: where two plates are sliding past eacch other
