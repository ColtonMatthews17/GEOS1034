Where do clouds come from?
  Heat causes water to evaporate and become water vapor, an invisible gas
  The water vapor rises, expands, then cools due to expansion
  
  Cold air cannot hold as much water vapor as warm air, thus cooling caused some of the water vapor 
    to condense back into droplets and ice crystals 

Clouds appear when invisible water vapor rises,cools and condenses to become visible liquid droplets and ice crystals

A drop in pressure causes air to expand and cool, causing invisibles water vapor to condense into visible droplets

Clouds are classified based on their height— higher clouds carry stronger winds and more rain and are called thunderstorms 

Thunderstorms have 3 phases
  Cumulus stage
  Mature stage
  Dissipating stage

The biggest thunderstorms are associated with cumulonimbus clouds (anvil= top of this cloud)

Weather fronts mark the boundary of air masses that have different temperatures
Cold fronts give rise to strong thunderstorms because they rapidly push warm moist air high into the atmosphere
Warm fronts give rise to gentle showers as warm air gradually gains altitude

A cold dry front pushes into warm moist air in Oklahoma resulting in large thunderstorm system

Dry air is more dense than moist air
Cold air is heavier than warm air




Strong thunderstorms produce these hazards…
  Lightning: a sudden electrostatic discharge between oppositely charged regions of a cloud or between a cloud and the ground
  Electric discharge: A strong separation of electric charges occurs as falling ice particles strip rising water molecules of their electrons
  Ground leaders: reach upwards to help make connection
    You need not be hit directly to be killed by lightning
Lightning carries an explosive punch

Lightning safety
  Do not take refuge under tall isolated objects
  Stop all activities and seek shelter in buildings, wait 30 min after to resume activities
  A lightning bolt raised the temperature of the air to over 50,000 degrees F, causing a rapid expansion of the air

Hail: forms when thunderstorm updrafts are strong enough to carry water droplets well above the freezing level
  This freezing process forms a hailstone, which can grow as additional water freezes onto it
  Eventually, the hailstone becomes too heavy for the updraft

Hail causes an average of $2.9 billion of damage each year

Microburst: areas of rapidly descending cold air that cause strong wind shear
  -Can destroy trees
  -Microbursts are particularly hazardous to aircraft during landings

Tornados: a violently rotating column of air that spins while in contact with both the surface and a cumulonimbus cloud
  -The most common source of strong tornadoes are supercells: large thunderstorms that rotate

A supercell forms when strong wind shear leads to a horizontal vortex that is then rotated upwards
  -Strong supercells develop rapidly rotating mesocyclones, from which a wall cloud may descend and in turn spawn a tornado

Strong supercells develop rapidly rotating mesocyclones, from which a wall cloud may descend and in turn spawn a tornado

Storng supercells develop rapidly rotating mesocyclones, from which a wall cloud may descend and in turn spawn a tornado

Mesocyclone, Wall Cloud, Tornado

A descending votex is not technically a tornado unless it makes contact with the ground

Tornadic winds are always directed inward toward the tornado (thogh not righ at the center)

Most US tornadoes occur in the midwest and south, which experiences about 1000 per year

The midwest has the right ingredients for tornado formation
  -Warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico
  -Cold Dry Air from the north
  -Warm, dry ait from the northwest

Peak tornado season in the U.S. occurs in the apring, when water from the Gulf of Mexico begin to warm,
  while cold air masses still descend from the north

Many parts of tge world experience tornado activity, though none to the degree of the U.S.

Enhanced Fujita Scale rates tornadoes strength based on the damage, which is used to estimate wind speed
  EFO: Light Damage
  EF1: Moderate Damage
  EF2: Considerable Damage
  EF3: Severe Damage
  EF4: Devastating Damage
  EF5: Incredible Damage

Most tornadoes are weak (EF0 and EF1)

Though only a small fraction of all tornadoes, EF4s and EF5s cause the most deaths

Superoutbreaks can spawn hundreds of tornadoes in a matter of days

A 2011 superoutbreak spawned 353 tornadoes over 4 days, the largest single outbreak ever recorded' 348 were killed

How wide can a tornado get?
  -The 2.6 mile 2013 El Reno Tornado (Oklahoma) was the widest tornado in recorded history (only an EF3)
    -A single Doppler radar revealed winds in excess of 296 mph, though damage assessments downgraded the tornadk to only an EF3
    -This tornado killed four storm chasers, the first known deaths in the history of storm chasing

1.3Mile wide Moore, Oklahoma
  -The path of destruction was 17 miles long
  -24 people died, 240 injured, 10000 homes destroyed

Can a tornado split into two tornadoes? No

Tornadoes cannot split or join, but multiple vortices are common, with each rotating about a larger tornado center

Tornado winds are ery difficult to measure

Fixed Doppler Radar can generally measure wind speeds a few kilometers above the grounf,
  but they are too high to measure tornado wind speeds.

Mobile Doppler Radar can measure wind speeds ~100meters above the ground (but most tornadoes will not be measured by mobile dopplers)

Measuring the wind peed within a tornado is one of the main goals of a professional storm chaser

Not Dorothy:TOTO(Totable Tornado Observatory)
  -Designd to be placed in the path of a tornado to record wind speeds, pressure, humidity, and tempuratue

Tornado Safety:
  -Tornado/Severe thunderstorm watch: Weather conditions are favorable for tonadoes. 
    BE ON ALERT
  -Tornado/Severe thunderstorm warning: A tornado has been spotted or is indicted by radar.
    TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO BE SAFE
  -Have a way to recieve tornado warnings at all hours
  -Do not rely on sirens (they are often not heard indoors), nor visibally
  -If outdoors: go indoors
  -If indoors: go to the basement; if no basement, go to a small gound floor interior room without windows.
  -If in a car and you see a tornade:
    -If no traffice drive away at right angles to the direction the tornado is traveling
    -If stuck in traffic and no obvioud selter

Overpasses act as wind tunnels that concentrate flying debris.

If at home, stay at home, dont get into your car and drive

Can tornado pick up a car? Yes
Can a tornado pick up a house intact? No
Can a tornado pick up an 8-Wheeler, cab and trailer? A tornado can pucj up an empty trailer
Can a tornado pick up a jetliner? No
Can a tornado pick up a small plane? Yes
Can a tornado pick up sharks? Actually, maybe..

Waterspouts are generally small tornadoes formed over water
  They have been known to pick up small fish and drop them hundreds of miles away

Wildfires cause great updrafts that can lead to fire tornadoes

Hot Air Balloons and Tumbleweeks are a great way to visualize cyclnic winds from fire

Dust Devils (too weak to be considered tornadoes) can occur any time winds become cyclonic
  Have been on Mars

Tornado Tanks exist..

THIS CLASS IS SO FUCKING BORING
