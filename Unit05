Volcano structure and hazards

Magma chamber: a reservoir of magma within the earths crust beneath a volcano
  -Can be imaged with seismic waves

Volcanic Conduit: also known as a volcanic vent
  -Connects the magma chamber to the surface, Channel through which magma travels to the surface

Eruption cloud and column: a cloud of super-heated ash and tephra suspended in gases.
  -The volcanic materials form a column that may rise many kilometers into the air above the vent of the volcano

Pyroclastic flow: a fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter (collectively known as tephra)

Lahar: a violent type of mudflow or debris flow composed of a slurry of pyroclastic material, rocky debris, and water.

Lava: melted rock above the surface
Magma: melted rock below the surface

Magma occurs only in a few special places close to the surface where tempuratures and pressures are sufficient to melt rock
  -Much less than 1% of Earths crust and mantle is actually melted rock

Melting rock can be caused by either an increase in tempurature OR a decrease in pressure OR addition of water (decrease in metling tempurate)

There are three types of volcanism: subduction zone, hot-spot, and mid-ocean ridge

Volcanism is found mostly near plate boundaries (mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones)

On average, mid-ocean ridges account for 70% of all volcanism each year
  (It takes alot of magma to keep churcning out new oceanic crust)
  -Volcanism can heat up bodies of water very fast
  -Black smokers - the origin of life?
  
Hawaii owes its existence to hot spot volcanism

Most of the world's surface volcanoes are associated with subduction

Subduction zone volcanism occurs when subducting plates bring water molecules down into the mantle
  where it lowers the melting tempurature of already  hot rocks, enabling them to melt and then rise

Question 1

What does Dr. Barnes get wrong in this scene?
  A Earthquakes can cause volcanic eruptions
  B Volcanism can heat bodies of water fairly fast
  C Tectonic plates float on an ocean of molten rock
  D All of the above

Answer: C

The shape of a volcano and the likelihood of it erupting eplosively versus effucively (calmly) is dependent in part on the viscosity of the magma
  -Viscosity is a measure of how easily a fluid flows
    -Higher viscosity, faster flow, lower viscosity, slower flow

Oct 2---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Low viscosity magmas lead to broad, shallow sloped volcanoes 
  -Shield volcanoes
High viscosity magmas lead the narrow, highly shaped sloped volcanoes
  -Cinder cone volcanoes

The Hawaiian Islands are shield volcanoes; their lava is very low viscosity that leads to broad topography

Stratovolcanoes are midsized volcanoes that form due to alternating layers of pyroclastic and lava flows

The most famous stratovolcano of them all: Mount Doom

Cinder cones are built when tephra are thrown out of a volcanic vent

Why do some volcanoes explode while other eruprt effusively (calmly)?
  -Magma contains dissolved gases (e.g. H20, CO2, SO2)
  - Dissolved gases expand as they near the surface and turn into gas bubbles and steam
  - This expansion causes pressure to build
  - If pressure is contained, it will grow until the rock above it breaks, leading to an explosion

The factors that influence whether a volcano will erupt explosivlely or effusively
  - Amount of magma: the ore magma, the more dissolved gases
  - Amunt of diss: some magmas have more dissolved gas than others
  - Viscosity of magma: magma must be fliud enough to flow, but sticky enough to trap expanding gases

Volcanic eruptions are categorized based on how explosive they are

Hawaiian eruptions are the calmest type due to very fliud lavas with low dissovled gas content

Strombolian eruptions are driven by the bursting of large gas bubbles tat frm from the colletion of many small ones

Volcanian eruptions are large enough to produce shock waves

Plinian eruptions are the largest and most violent, sending columns of pulverized rock and ash miles up into the atmosphere

The power of dissolved fas to expand, build pressure, and volcanically explode, can by demonstrated with Diet Coke and Mentos

low volume + low pressure = hawaiian
low volume + high pressure  = strombolian
high volume + low pressure = volcanian
high pressure + high pressure = plinian

Ash induced lightning exists

Lava lake overflowing

More than 250,000 people have been killed by volcanic hazards in the past 500 years

Lava is the least cause of conern when it comes to volcanic hazards

Though lava is very hot (2000f, 1200C), it usually moves slow enough and remotely so as to not be too hazardous

Lava flows can sometimes by stopped by spraying water on them

Sometimes the direction of a lava flow can be altered

Explosive eruptions throw out a variety of rocks (collectively called tephra) that come in different shapzed, sizes, and densities

Volcanic Ash:
  -Saller than sand grains
  -Hard, abrasive, corrosive, eletrical conducting, and do not dissolve in water
  -Not fluffy like ash from wood or BBQ
  -15cm of wet ash can collapse a roof
  -5cm can kill crops
  -1mm will close an airport
  -Will short out electrical equipment
  -Will interefere with radio signals
  -Will clog engines

Oct7----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explosive eruptions throw out pumice, a volcanic rock with so many trapped gas bubbles that it floats

Volcanic bombs form when an eruption ejects lava that hardens in flight or fragments of previously cooled lava chunks

Pyroclastic flows are the most dangerous volcanic hazard for anyone nearby
  -Pyroclastic flows are the heavier parts of an explosive eruption that run dow the flank of a volcano at up to 200 mph,
      powered by expanding hot gasews at over 1000* Celcius

The eruption of Mt. St. Helens initiated with an acalane that become a large pyroclastic flow
  -This eruption produced a large pyroclastic flow

Lahars (mudflows) are avalanches of ash, soil, rock, and water tat can occur days or even months after an eruption
  -Have killed 10s of thousands of people

Towns are built in the path of past mudflows from Mount Rainer

Volcanoes can create lakes dense with sulfuric and hydrocloric acid, but the procss takes many years

Vog: The 1986 tragedy of Cameroon, West Africa
  -Volcanic gases within laval lakes can create a volcanic smog (vog) made of deadly concetrations of CO2
  -Vog weighs more than air and athis can sweep downhill very fast
  -In 1986 a vog was suddenly created over Lake Nyos, Cameroon and swept through a village killing many

Volcanic eruptions often are preceded by several pecursors
  -Earthquake frequency increases
  -Harmonic Tremors
  -Gas release (sulfur or carbon dioxide)
  -Rapid ground deformation (uplift or tilt)
  -Surface temperature increase

Harmonic tremot: A continuous release of seismic energy typicaly associated with the undergroun movement of magma.

Harmonic temor can be cause y anything moving underground

Before the eruption of Mount St. Helens, the surface was observed to bulge ouwards

Release of Carbon Dixoide gas killed trees on Mammoth volcano in California

Quiz Question

A No, like earthquakes they are unpredictable
B Yes, very easily
C Yes, but such predictions are never straightforward
