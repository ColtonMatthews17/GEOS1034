The duration of shaking inreases with earthquake magnitude

To build a new San Francisco, the rubble from the old one was scraped into the bay,
  creating a new shoreline of a very unconsolidated nature.

Loose sediments amplify seismic shaking
The marina disrict, built on 1906 earthquake rubble, experienced some of the most intense shaking during the 1989 earthquake.

Sediments in the Santa Rosa Basin greatly magnified the amplitude and duration of shaking during the 1906 earthquake.

QUIZ Q

What is the difference between earthquake intensity and earthquake magnitude?
A: Intensity refers to the effects that earthquakes have, magnitude refers to energy released.

Mercalli Intensities: The shaking that people and buildings actually feel
  -Based on felt reports
  -Can be used to estimate the size of historic earthquakes

**picture of mercalli intensity scale**

Mercallle Intensities provide a means of estimating how destructive an earthquake was likely to be.
The 2001 M9.1 Sumatra earthquake (2.5 less shaking than a 9.5) was felt 2700 km away

For the same magnitude earthquake, shaking is felt further away in the eastern US compared to the western US
Shaking is more intense in the East because the crust is stronger (less active faults breaking it up) and transmits seismic energy better

Earthquakes occur in the Midwest/South (far from any plate boundaries) due to the reactivization of ancient faults
  The New Madrid Seismic Zone is thought to be the reactivization of an ancient failed rift system.
