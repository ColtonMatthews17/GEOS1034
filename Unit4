UNIT 4: TSUNAMI

A tsunami is a series of waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of water

A tsunami has the power to strip the land before
  -Everything gets wrecked

One of the major hazards of a tsunami is the tremendous amount of debris the water picks up and carries inland

The most common means of generating a tsunai is elastic rebound during a large subduction zone earthquake

The 2004 Suatra tsunami was caused bya  subduction zone earthquake that extended from 1000 km

Tsunai waves can have similar heights to large win blown waves, but carry a much longer volume of water and travel much further inland

Tsunami wave mechanics
  -Out at sea (in deep water) tsunami waves hvae long wavelengths (distance from crest to crest), low wave heights, and great speed
  -As waves approach shore they slow down, which allows the back of the waves to catch up the front,
    reducing wavelength, but increasing wave height
  -The trough occurs when the wave goes out to sea before hitting

2011 Japan tsunami wave heights in the open ocean where 1 meter or less, but reached more than 10 meters as they approached the shore

Tsunami waves (like all water waves) break when the wave height is about equal to the water depth

Problems with San Andreas:
  -The tsunami wave is ridiculously large
  -It should have broken further out at sea
  -The San Andreas Fault cannot generate a tsunami - it is a strike slip fault mostly on land

In-Class Question
What's wrong with this scene?
  -a Tsunami waves out at sea should habe smaller heights
  -b Tsunami waves do not break in deep water
  -c Both of the above

Problem in Interstellar Scene:
  -The tsunami is ridiculously tall and narrow
  -You cant have a 1000 foot high wave pass through 1 foot of water without breaking
  -The is no trough, just a crest

A tsunami wave can continue coming on shore for 20 minutes and reach many miles inland

A tsunami wave can catch people inland unaware

If you are in your car, and the streets sudently fill with water, stay in your car and ride it out

Inlets trapped the 2011 Japan tsunami causing the water to rise

Japan tsunami heights were sufficient enough to put boats and houses ontop of houses
