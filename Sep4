Unit 2: Earthquakes

Largest Earthquakes:
  -Chile      1960, 9.5M, 11min
  -Alaska     1964, 9.2M, 5min
  -Sumatra    2004, 9.1M, 5min
  -Japan      2011, 9.0M, 6min
  -Kamchatka  1952, 9.0M, 4min

About 1.5 million earthquakes do occur around the glob each year,
  -Average 1 earthquake > 8 each year
  -15 above 7
  -134 above 6
  -1,319 above 5
  -13,000 above 4
  -130,000 above 3
  -1,300,000 above 2

2011 quake did move a portion of Japan 8 feet

The energy release from the 1964 alaska earthquake was more like 150,000 atom bombs

Hilo Hawaii was destroyed by a 35 foot high tsunami following the 1964 chile earthquake 6500 miles away.

We are probably overdue for an earthquake on the southern San Andreas Fault
  On average, large earhquakes recur on the San Andreas fault every 150 years.

An earthquake is a sudden break in the Earth's crust taht occurs after a long period of stress buildup due to motions of the tectonics plates.
  -Hypecenter is qhere the earthquakes starts (under earth)
  -Epicenter is point on the surface of the earth where the earthquake happens (directly aboce hypocenter)

Two processes describe the earthquake cycle:
  1. Elastic Rebound: The crust deforms elastically (storing energy), then rebounds (like a ball)
    a: Original position
    b: Deformation
    c: Rupture and release of energy
    d: Rocks rebound to original undeformed shape

  2. Stick-Slip Behavior: a fault remains locked while energy builds, then slips suddenly

Elastic Rebound ans stick slip behavior associated with a subduction zone earthquake

Stick-Slip behavior occurs because of friction:
  Rough spots along the fault (called asperities or protrusions) prevent the fault from sliding until they are broken

The San Francisco region is currently building stress on faults and elastic energy within the crust toward a large earthquake
